## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Procedure:

1.  we need to download the project from the Udacity Instructions page where the link is provided.
2.  It navigates to the Git repository there we need to download the zip folder.
3.  We are given CSS, image ,JS folder and index ,readme files.

## Steps to be followed after cloning the files

1.  We need to modify the app.js file to bring the project into an interactive one.
2.  We are provided with some starter code in the app.js file.
3.  After running the index file in browser we will be having the grid layout.
4.  Now we need to add the cards to the grid layout this is done by adding all elements to the array
    and by using Query selector we are going to get all the cards into that array of grid layout.
5.  Now we need to add the shuffle() function to shuffle the cards.  
6.  After Shuffling of cards we need add the matching condition so that if two cards of same type matches then they should be opened or else they go to the disabled state.
7.  Now we need to add the moves counter to count the number of attempts we did for matching.
8.  After that we need give the rating to the player according to his attempts like sing star
    2 star or three stars.
9.  we need to add the time counter so that it shows how much time taken by the user to match all the cards.
10. After matching all the cards we need to add a pop up menu to show your completion along with
    count of moves ,time taken to complete and the rating given to you.

## Conclusion

 By this project I learnt how to combine the large applications by using the CSS,HTML and
 JavaScript. How to use the JavaScript and DOM manipulations to build the complex applications
 and different functionalities of JavaScript are learnt.
 I feel pleasure for such a beautiful project provided by the Udacity team.
